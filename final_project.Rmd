```{r, creating a graph of medals won by the top scoring counties}

# I created a graph of the medals won by the top scoring countries and divided
# the medals by what kind of medal they are also. I did this for the summer games
# and then in my shiny app I copy and pasted the code again to make the same thing
# for the winter season but used the winter data set instead.

# First I took the summer medal data set and selected the variables that I needed to 
# make the data set. I chose country medal and year. 
# I then grouped by country to get the medals won per country. I also grouped by medal
# because I wanted to also know how many of each kind of medal.
# I then counted by country to know how mnay each country got.
# I then arranged by desc so that I could select the top medaling countries. I used head
# to take the top countries and selected 30 so that I got around 10ish countries.
# I then used ggplot to plot the graph with the right axes and used group and fill for 
# medal so that the different medals were different colors.
# I used geom_col to make columns for the data.
# I added labels and a theme command to make the title large and bolded.
