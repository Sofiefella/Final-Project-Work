Medals:
```{r, creating a graph of medals won by the top scoring counties}

# I created a graph of the medals won by the top scoring countries and divided
# the medals by what kind of medal they are also. I did this for the summer games
# and then in my shiny app I copy and pasted the code again to make the same thing
# for the winter season but used the winter data set instead.

# First I took the summer medal data set and selected the variables that I needed to 
# make the data set. I chose country medal and year. 
# I then grouped by country to get the medals won per country. I also grouped by medal
# because I wanted to also know how many of each kind of medal.
# I then counted by country to know how mnay each country got.
# I then arranged by desc so that I could select the top medaling countries. I used head
# to take the top countries and selected 30 so that I got around 10ish countries.
# I then used ggplot to plot the graph with the right axes and used group and fill for 
# medal so that the different medals were different colors.
# I used geom_col to make columns for the data.
# I added labels and a theme command to make the title large and bolded.

summer_medals %>%

Gender Trends:
```{r, creating a graph of gender trends by season}

# I created a graph of the trends of the number of male and female athletes that
# were participating in the summer games. I did this for the summer games and then
# in my shiny app I copy and pasted the code again to make the same thing
# for the winter season but used filter == winter instead.

# I grouped by year and sex to see how the trends in male vs female participation
# changed over the years of the Olympics.
# I then counted to get the total number of each gender in each year.
# I then arranged by year to get the most recent numbers at the bottom and the first
# games at the top of the list.

Gender_Per_Year <- athlete_events %>%
  filter(Season == "Summer") %>%

# I took the data I modified above and pipped it into ggplot with year on the x axis
# and te number of athletes on the y axis. I grouped by sex and made them different
# colors to make the data pop.
# I added geom point and geom line to make it a line graph.
# Labs added in labels and a title and subtitle.
# I added a theme command to make the title large and bolded.

```

Trends: Athletes, Events, Nations
```{r, making a series of overall trend graphs}

# I wante to make a series of three overall trend graphs: athletes, events, nations.
# I took this graph for athletes and used it as a template for the next two. Only for 
# the events and nations I just adjusted the summarize command so instead of 
# athletes = length(unique(ID)) it would be for events = or nations = . I then adjusted
# the axes to make this graph for events and nations as well just by changing the y axis 
# variable. I made the new graphs in shiny.

# First I took the big data set and filtered for sport so that I was only looking at the 
# main sport events and wasn't looking at the art competitions.
# I grouped by year and season to get the number of athletes per year per season to look
# at the trends that differed by winter or summer.
# I then summarized to create an athletes variable that only took each name, or ID, once 
# because several of the athletes are listed many times due to being in many events. That 
# is why I used the length(unique(ID)) command so each name only came up once.

athlete_data <- athlete_events %>% 
  filter(Sport != "Art Competitions") %>%
  group_by(Year, Season) %>%
  summarize(Athletes = length(unique(ID)))

# I then used ggplot to createa plot with the year on the x axis and the number of athletes 
# on the y axis. I grouped by and colored season to get two separate plots one for each season
# and I colored them to make them stick out.
# I added geom point and line to make a line graph of the data.
# I added scale color manual because I wanted to be able to select the colors of the lines on the
# graph. I added labs to add in labels and axis titles.
# I added a theme command to make the title large and bolded.

athlete_data %>%       
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Athletes, group = Season, color = Season)) +

Maps of Origin:
```{r, making the maps of where athletes came from}

# Here I made one basic template for a map and then in my shiny app I adjusted the template
# to make maps for several different games and the years they were hosted. All I had to
# do to do that is change every country name/date in the following code. For example, for the
# sochi map every time paris appears in the template I switched it to sochi and for the title
# and filter command I changed the year as well.

# First I took the athletes data set and joined it with another region data set that I got off
# the internet. I then used na.omit to get rid of all the na values in the regions column of the 
# data set. I stored this all as regions.

regions <- athlete_events %>% 
  left_join(noc_regions, by = "NOC") %>%
  na.omit(regions)

# I then took the region data and filtered for the paris games which were in 1900 and they were
# the summer games. I then grouped by region to get the region that everyone came from as different
# groups. I then created a Paris variable that took every athlete and only selected their name
# once so I wouldn't double count someone coming from one place.
      
Paris_data <- regions %>% 
  filter(Games == "1900 Summer") %>%
  group_by(region) %>%
  summarize(Paris = length(unique(ID)))

# I then used the map_data command to turn data from the maps package in to a data frame suitable 
# for plotting with ggplot2. I set the region to world because I wanted to plot the data everywhere
# in the world. I saved this data.

world <- map_data("world")
   
# I then created a new data set where region was only listed once. I did this again by using the 
# unique command so the same regions weren't grouped multiple times.

map_data <- tibble(region = unique(world$region))

# I then took the new map data and joined it together wiht my Paris data by region.      

map_data <- map_data %>% 
  left_join(Paris_data, by = "region")

# I then took the Paris value in the map_data and got rid of the na values.
  
map_data$Paris[is.na(map_data$Paris)] <- 0
      
# I then joined together the updated map data datset and the world data by region.

world <- left_join(world, map_data, by = "region")
      
# Once I had all the data I created a plot of the data with the long and lat values
# as the axis labels so that I would be making a map. 
# I grouped by group so every group of people from a region would be together.
# I added geom_polygon to create a map and used fill to add in the Paris data.
# I used guides and scale fill gradient to make a gradient legend that showed the 
# white regions of the graph to be where few athletes were from and a bright orange
# where the athletes are concentrated. The legend shows this.
# I used labs to add a title.
# I used theme to get rid of the axis ticks and text. I made the background navy like
# a normal map would be.

ggplot(world, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(fill = Paris)) +
  guides(fill = guide_colourbar(title = "Athletes")) +

```

Body Characteristics:
```{r, making height and weight trend graphs}

# I made the code for one graph and then when I went to make the weight graph I 
# just switched the y axis variable to weight instead of the current height one.

# I took the big athlete data set and took out the na values and pipped it into a 
# ggplot that made Year a factor variable and plotted the height values on the y axis.
# I then filled by sex so that there would be two separate trends that showed the difference
# in the two genders.
# I added geom_boxplot to make a boxplot of the data.
# I then used scale fill manual so that I could pick the colors of the different graph values.
# I then had to adjust the size and angle of the year values so that they would be small enough
# to all fit on the axis without overlapping.
# I added in labs to make a nice title, subtitle, and axes labels.
# I used theme to make the title bolded and large.

athlete_events %>% 
  na.omit() %>%

Age:
```{r, making an age histogram per season}

# I took the big data set and took out all of the na.omit values.
# I pipped it into ggplot to make a plot with age on the x axis.
# I added in geom_histogram to make a histogram with the height representing the number
# of athletes in each height bin. I added some cool colors in the graph as well.
# I facted by sex to get two separate graphs by gender.
# I added in labs to make a nice title and axes labels.
# I added theme to get rid of the legend, and to make the title large and bold.
